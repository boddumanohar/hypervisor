# Note:
#
# To use this script, you need to create a compilation database, which
# can be done by installing bear on your system, and running make with
# bear:
#
#   STATIC_ANALYSIS_ENABLED=true bear make
#
# Once you have compiled Bareflank and created a compilation database,
# you should be able to run this script which will tell you if there are
# any issues with the code. The following describes what we turned off
# and why:
#
# - CastToStruct: we disable this at the moment because we are doing a lot
#   of legit casting in the ELF loader, as this is really how the spec is
#   written.
#
# - UnreachableCode: we disable this because it seems to output buggy
#   results. For some reason, anything with a try catch block, this seems
#   to get triggered. Furthermore, its not really needed since Coveralls tells
#   us if code cannot be reached, which is also evidence this check is not
#   working right, as it has a lot of false positives.
#
# - reinterpret-cast: There are legit cases where we need reinterpret_cast.
#   As a result, we have disabled this. That being said, each instance were
#   it is used has been reviewed, and determined to be needed. The remaining
#   instances were removed in place of safer code.
#
# - braces-around-statements: Simply disagree with this one, and has
#   actually been proposed and declined for the C++ Core Guidelines. Instead,
#   analysis tools should detect incorrect indentation when these types
#   of errors occur.
#
# - cert-err60-cpp: This not only triggers an issue with Hippomocks, but is
#   also triggering on std::run_time and std::logic_error on Travis CI,
#   so we have it turned off where needed.
#
# Additional Note:
#
# Currently we have -Wcast-align disabled for C as clang-tidy does not have
# a way to turn this off and it complains about the ELF loader. This means
# that right now, we only support archiectures with byte alignment.
