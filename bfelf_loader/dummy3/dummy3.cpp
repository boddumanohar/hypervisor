// Note that attempts to get a reference to any global data appears to be
// broken. In the case below, attempting to call p_blah2->fool() will crash.
// Instead, here, we call p_blah2.foo() which seems to work fine.
//
// Note that through testing, attempts to get a reference to any global
// data will crash eventually. In the case described above, it will crash
// instantly, but if you grab a reference to simply a global variable, it
// seems to work fine some of the time, and crashes other times. Not entirely
// sure why. What's really strange is that when it doesn't crash, the data
// that it has is valid. At any rate our current belief is that this is a
// bug with GCC, likely being exposed due to the way we have it configured.
